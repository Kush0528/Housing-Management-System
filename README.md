# Housing-Management-System

## Project Overview
The main aim of the project is to create a comprehensive and efficient database that simplifies the process of managing student housing, ensuring both property owners and student tenants experience the highest level of convenience and satisfaction. The database will contain records of House information, Leasing details, Tenant details, and Apartment reviews.

This system will help the students and property owners in the following ways:  
- It allows students to check out and select the houses that perfectly suit them during their studies.  
- It allows property owners to track the occupancy, lease agreements, and rental history.

## Problem Statement
Current housing management systems for students lack the efficiency and accessibility required to address the diverse needs of the student population. Students, as the primary end-users, often struggle to access comprehensive and user-friendly housing data, hindering their ability to make well-informed decisions about their housing arrangements. Lease providers, including landlords and property management firms, face challenges in managing tenant records and property availability, resulting in a less-than-optimal leasing process.

## Proposed Solution
This Housing Management System offers an enhanced user experience for all its stakeholders by facilitating online interaction and information exchange. This system effectively addresses multiple administrative challenges, simplifying data storage, maintenance, and accessibility. It eliminates the inefficiencies associated with physical record-keeping, optimizing space usage.
